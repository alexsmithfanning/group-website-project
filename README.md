# Web Design group project



## Contributing to this project

All pull requests will be ignored unless you are an active part of my group with a GitHub account. This project does not allow outside sources of contribution.

Submitting a pull request allows you to contribute to this project without modifying the primary codebase, thereby significantly reducing the risk of seriously breaking anything important.

In order to create a pull request, you first have to fork the project into your own account as a forked repository. To fork a project, click the `Fork` button near the top right corner of the page. It will then take you to your forked version of the code which you can do anything you want to. When you want to merge your changes back into the main repository, go to the repository page and click `New pull request`. Then just choose your modified version and the rest of the team will review the code and resolve any merge conflicts.

## Submitting issues

If you find an issue with the code, create an issue for it and the group will look it over.

To create an issue, go to the **issues tab** and and click on `New Issue`.
