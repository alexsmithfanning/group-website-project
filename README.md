## Contributing to this project

**All pull requests will be ignored unless you are an active part of my group with a GitHub account. This project does not allow outside sources of contribution.**

Submitting a pull request allows you to contribute to this project without modifying the primary codebase, thereby significantly reducing the risk of seriously breaking anything important.

In order to create a pull request, you first have to fork the project into your own account as a forked repository. To fork a project, click the `Fork` button near the top right corner of the page. It will then take you to your forked version of the code which you can do anything you want to. When you want to merge your changes back into the main repository, go to the repository page and click `New pull request`. Then just choose your modified version and the rest of the team will review the code and resolve any merge conflicts.

## Submitting issues

If you find an issue with the code, create an issue for it and the group will look it over.

To create an issue, go to the **issues tab** and and click on `New Issue`.

## Creating a GitHub account

In order to access GitHub, you first need to create an account. If you don't have one, get one now. A GitHub account is free and you get access to all the cool features that GitHub (and Git) provide!

## Using Git

First and foremost, you need to know the basics of Git and how to install it. <a href="https://git-scm.com/doc">Head on over here</a> to see the documentation and reference implementation.

The <a href="https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf">GitHub/Git Cheat Sheet</a> is also of some use. It will allow you to quickly get started using Git.

## Project information

### Font choice

I chose the Roboto font for our project. I chose it because of how many different types and styles it has. To give you an idea of how many, here's a small table of the font types and weights that Roboto offers:

| Font name        | Weight    | Style | Has italic counterpart |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----- | ---------------------- |
| Roboto Thin      | 100       | Sans  | Yes                    |
| Roboto Light     | 300       | Sans  | Yes                    |
